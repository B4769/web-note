# Html5

- Its the final version of html inthe world wide web and is a markup language used for structuring and presenting content on the web.Its goals were to improve the language with support for the latest multimedia and other new features; to keep the language both easily readable by humans and consistently understood by computers and devices such as web browser, parsers, etc.; and used to keep the language both easily readable by humans and consistently understood by computers

# SCSS

- Is two syntax flavor for the same concept. It can be used to style the visual elements of a webpage, including buttons, sliders, images, color schemes, fonts, themes, and layouts.
- **SCSS is a great way to improve your CSS workflow. It can help you keep your code clean and organized, and make it easier to maintain your stylesheets over time.**
    
    
- The benefite of SCSS
- **Increased productivity**
- **Better code organization**
- **Improved maintainability and readability**
- **More powerful than CSS alone**
- I**t adds features to CSS code**

# CSS Transition

- Is a module of css that lets you create gradual **transitions** between the values of specific css  properties. provide a way to control animation speed when changing CSS properties.
- CSS transitions  decide which properties to animate (by *listing them explicitly*), when the animation will start (by setting a *delay)*, how long the transition will last (by setting a *duration*), and how the transition will run (by defining a *timing function*, e.g., linearly or quick at the beginning, slow at the end)

# CSS Selector

- define the pattern to select elements to which a set of CSS rules are then applied.  Used to find out and selects the HTML element(s) we want to style. also helpful when you want to make a change - you only need to make the change in one place, which saves you a lot of time.
- we can devide css selector into five major catagories

## 1.Simple selector(selects element based on the name, id,class)

**The id selector** uses the id attribute of an HTML element to select a specific element.

The id of an element is unique within a page, so the id selector is used to select one unique element.

Can not start with number.

To select an element with a specific id, write a hash (#) character, followed by the id of the element.

**The class selector** selects HTML elements with a specific class attribute.

To select elements with a specific class, write a period (.) character, followed by the class name.

**The universal selector** (*) selects all HTML elements on the page.

**The CSS type selector** selects all HTML elements of the specified type.

To use it, mention the name of the HTML element.

## 2. [Combinator selectors](https://www.w3schools.com/CSS/css_combinators.asp) (select elements based on a specific relationship between them)

There are four types of combinators:

- The descendant combinator: selects only the descendants of the specified element.you first mention the parent element, leave a space, and then mention the descendant of the first element, which is the child element of the parent. The child element is an element inside the parent element.
- The direct child combinator: selects only the direct children of the parent.To use the direct child combinator, specify the parent element, then add the `>` character followed by the direct children of the parent element you want to select.There is a `div` which is the parent element.
- The general sibling combinator: selects siblings. specify the first element, then use the `~` character followed by the second element that needs to follow the first one.`p` elements that come after the `div`.
- The adjacent sibling combinator: is more specific than the general sibling combinator.This selector matches only the *immediate* siblings. Immediate siblings are the siblings that come right after the first element.

## 3.****Pseudo-Class Selectors****

- The element is being hovered over by the mouse pointer.
- The element is the first of its type.
- The link has been visited before from that specific browser.
- The link has *not* been visited before from that specific browser.
- The checkbox/radio button has been checked.

## 4.****Pseudo-Element Selectors****

- used for styling a specific part of an element - you can use them to insert new content or change the look of a specific section of the content. can use a pseudo-element to style the first letter or the first line of an element differently.

## 5.**CSS Attribute Selectors**

Many HTML elements have attributes.

1. [The `[attribute]` selector](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/css-selectors-cheat-sheet-for-beginners/#attr-1)
2. [The `[attribute="value"]` selector](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/css-selectors-cheat-sheet-for-beginners/#attr-2)
3. [The `[attribute^="value"]` selector](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/css-selectors-cheat-sheet-for-beginners/#attr-3)
4. [The `[attribute$="value"]` selector](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/css-selectors-cheat-sheet-for-beginners/#attr-4)
5. [The `[attribute*="value"]` selector](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/css-selectors-cheat-sheet-for-beginners/#attr-5)
6. [The `[attribute~="value"]` selector](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/css-selectors-cheat-sheet-for-beginners/#attr-6)

HTML attributes:

- Provide additional information about HTML elements.
- Are always specified in the start (or opening) tag.
- Usually come in name/value pairs such as `name="value"`.
- The `value` in a name/value pair should be enclosed in quotation marks.

## 6.****Grouping CSS Selector****

- we can target and style more than one element at once. To use the grouping selector, use a comma, `,` to group and separate the different elements you want to select.
- For example, here is how you would target multiple elements such as `div`s, `p`s, and `span`s all at once and apply the same styles to each of them.

# Transistor

A transistor is really simple—and really complex. Let's start with the simple part. A transistor is a miniature electronic component that can do two different jobs. It can work either as an [amplifier](https://www.explainthatstuff.com/amplifiers.html) or a switch.

# How transistor works?

- When it works as an **amplifier**, it takes in a tiny [electric current](https://www.explainthatstuff.com/electricity.html) at one end (an input current) and produces a much bigger electric current (an output current) at the other.
- Transistors can also work as **switches**. A tiny electric current flowing through one part of a transistor can make a much bigger current flow through another part of it.

# Bootstrap (5)

- **Bootstrap** is the most popular **CSS Framework** for developing responsive and mobile-first websites. a free front-end framework for faster and easier web [development. It](http://development.It) includes HTML and CSS based design templates for typography, forms, buttons, tables, navigation, modals, image carousels and many other, as well as optional JavaScript plugins
- Bootstrap also gives you the ability to easily create responsive designs
- **Bootstrap 5** is the newest version of Bootstrap. Is the newest version of [Bootstrap](https://www.w3schools.com/bootstrap/default.asp), which is the most popular HTML, CSS, and JavaScript framework for creating responsive, mobile-first websites.
- Its with new components, faster stylesheet and more responsiveness and supports the latest, stable releases of all major browsers and platforms. However, Internet Explorer 11 and down is not supported.
- Advantages:
    - **Easy to use:** Anybody with just basic knowledge of HTML and CSS can start using Bootstrap
    - **Responsive features:** Bootstrap's responsive CSS adjusts to phones, tablets, and desktops
    - **Mobile-first approach:** In Bootstrap, mobile-first styles are part of the core framework
    - **Browser compatibility:** Bootstrap 5 is compatible with all modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari, and Opera).
- There are two ways to start using Bootstrap 5 on our websites.
- we can
    - Include Bootstrap 5 from a CDN
    - Download Bootstrap 5 from getbootstrap.com

    ****Precompiled Bootstrap****
    
    ## **CSS files**
    
    Bootstrap includes a handful of options for including some or all of our compiled CSS.
    
    ## **JS files**
    
    Similarly, we have options for including some or all of our compiled JavaScript.
    
    ****Bootstrap source code****
    
    ### Breakpoints
    
    Breakpoints are customizable widths that determine how your responsive layout behaves across device or viewport sizes in Bootstrap.
    
    ## **Core concepts**
    
    - **Breakpoints are the building blocks of responsive design.** Use them to control when your layout can be adapted at a particular viewport or device size.
    - **Use media queries to architect your CSS by breakpoint.** Media queries are a feature of CSS that allow you to conditionally apply styles based on a set of browser and operating system parameters. We most commonly use `min-width` in our media queries.
    - **Mobile first, responsive design is the goal.** Bootstrap’s CSS aims to apply the bare minimum of styles to make a layout work at the smallest breakpoint, and then layers on styles to adjust that design for larger devices. This optimizes your CSS, improves rendering time, and provides a great experience for your visitors.
    - 
    
    ## **Available breakpoints**
    
    Bootstrap includes six default breakpoints, sometimes referred to as *grid tiers*, for building responsively. These breakpoints can be customized if you’re using our source Sass files.
    
    | Breakpoint | Class infix | Dimensions |
    | --- | --- | --- |
    | X-Small | None | <576px |
    | Small | sm | ≥576px |
    | Medium | md | ≥768px |
    | Large | lg | ≥992px |
    | Extra large | xl | ≥1200px |
    | Extra extra large | xxl | ≥1400px |

# **Containers**

Containers are a fundamental building block of Bootstrap that contain, pad, and align your content within a given device or viewport.

## **How they work**

Containers are the most basic layout element in Bootstrap and are **required when using our default grid system**. Containers are used to contain, pad, and (sometimes) center the content within them. While containers *can* be nested, most layouts do not require a nested container.

Bootstrap comes with three different containers:

- `.container`, which sets a `max-width` at each responsive breakpoint
- `.container-fluid`, which is `width: 100%` at all breakpoints
- `.container-{breakpoint}`, which is `width: 100%` until the specified breakpoint
- 

| Extra small<576px | Small≥576px | Medium≥768px | Large≥992px | X-Large≥1200px | XX-Large≥1400px |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| .container | 100% | 540px | 720px | 960px | 1140px |
| .container-sm | 100% | 540px | 720px | 960px | 1140px |
| .container-md | 100% | 100% | 720px | 960px | 1140px |
| .container-lg | 100% | 100% | 100% | 960px | 1140px |
| .container-xl | 100% | 100% | 100% | 100% | 1140px |
| .container-xxl | 100% | 100% | 100% | 100% | 100% |
| .container-fluid | 100% | 100% | 100% | 100% | 100% |

# **Grid system**

Use our powerful mobile-first flexbox grid to build layouts of all shapes and sizes thanks to a twelve column system, six default responsive tiers, Sass variables and mixins, and dozens of predefined classes.

## **How it works**

Breaking it down, here’s how the grid system comes together:

- **Our grid supports [six responsive breakpoints](notion://www.notion.so/breakpoints/index.html).** Breakpoints are based on `min-width` media queries, meaning they affect that breakpoint and all those above it (e.g., `.col-sm-4` applies to `sm`, `md`, `lg`, `xl`, and `xxl`). This means you can control container and column sizing and behavior by each breakpoint.
- **Containers center and horizontally pad your content.** Use `.container` for a responsive pixel width, `.container-fluid` for `width: 100%` across all viewports and devices, or a responsive container (e.g., `.container-md`) for a combination of fluid and pixel widths.
- **Rows are wrappers for columns.** Each column has horizontal `padding` (called a gutter) for controlling the space between them. This `padding` is then counteracted on the rows with negative margins to ensure the content in your columns is visually aligned down the left side. Rows also support modifier classes to [uniformly apply column sizing](notion://www.notion.so/web-note1-775648359dc84837a4100c9d97898faf#row-columns) and [gutter classes](notion://www.notion.so/gutters/index.html) to change the spacing of your content.
- **Columns are incredibly flexible.** There are 12 template columns available per row, allowing you to create different combinations of elements that span any number of columns. Column classes indicate the number of template columns to span (e.g., `col-4` spans four). `width`s are set in percentages so you always have the same relative sizing.
- **Gutters are also responsive and customizable.** [Gutter classes are available](notion://www.notion.so/gutters/index.html) across all breakpoints, with all the same sizes as our [margin and padding spacing](notion://www.notion.so/utilities/spacing/index.html). Change horizontal gutters with `.gx-*` classes, vertical gutters with `.gy-*`, or all gutters with `.g-*` classes. `.g-0` is also available to remove gutters.
- **Sass variables, maps, and mixins power the grid.** If you don’t want to use the predefined grid classes in Bootstrap, you can use our [grid’s source Sass](notion://www.notion.so/web-note1-775648359dc84837a4100c9d97898faf#sass) to create your own with more semantic markup. We also include some CSS custom properties to consume these Sass variables for even greater flexibility for you.

****Grid options****

Bootstrap’s grid system can adapt across all six default breakpoints, and any breakpoints you customize. The six default grid tiers are as follow:

- Extra small (xs)
- Small (sm)
- Medium (md)
- Large (lg)
- Extra large (xl)
- Extra extra large (xxl)

## **Auto-layout columns**

Utilize breakpoint-specific column classes for easy column sizing without an explicit numbered class like `.col-sm-6`.

### **Equal-width**

For example, here are two grid layouts that apply to every device and viewport, from `xs` to `xxl`. Add any number of unit-less classes for each breakpoint you need and every column will be the same width.

# **Columns**

Learn how to modify columns with a handful of options for alignment, ordering, and offsetting thanks to our flexbox grid system. Plus, see how to use column classes to manage widths of non-grid elements.

## **How they work**

- **Columns build on the grid’s flexbox architecture.** Flexbox means we have options for changing individual columns and [modifying groups of columns at the row level](notion://www.notion.so/grid/index.html#row-columns). You choose how columns grow, shrink, or otherwise change.
- **When building grid layouts, all content goes in columns.** The hierarchy of Bootstrap’s grid goes from [container](notion://www.notion.so/containers/index.html) to row to column to your content. On rare occasions, you may combine content and column, but be aware there can be unintended consequences.
- **Bootstrap includes predefined classes for creating fast, responsive layouts.** With [six breakpoints](notion://www.notion.so/breakpoints/index.html) and a dozen columns at each grid tier, we have dozens of classes already built for you to create your desired layouts. This can be disabled via Sass if you wish.
- 

## **Alignment**

Use flexbox alignment utilities to vertically and horizontally align columns.

- **Vertical alignment**
- ****Horizontal alignment****
- ****Column wrapping****
- ****Column breaks****

# **Gutters**

Gutters are the padding between your columns, used to responsively space and align content in the Bootstrap grid system.

## **How they work**

- **Gutters are the gaps between column content, created by horizontal `padding`.** We set `padding-right` and `padding-left` on each column, and use negative `margin` to offset that at the start and end of each row to align content.
- **Gutters start at `1.5rem` (`24px`) wide.** This allows us to match our grid to the [padding and margin spacers](notion://www.notion.so/utilities/spacing/index.html) scale.
- **Gutters can be responsively adjusted.** Use breakpoint-specific gutter classes to modify horizontal gutters, vertical gutters, and all gutters.

## **Horizontal gutters**

`.gx-*` classes can be used to control the horizontal gutter widths.

## **Vertical gutters**

`.gy-*` classes can be used to control the vertical gutter widths.

## **Horizontal & vertical gutters**

`.g-*` classes can be used to control the horizontal gutter widths, for the following example we use 

a smaller gutter width, so there won’t be a need to add the `.overflow-hidden` wrapper class.

## **Row columns gutters**

Gutter classes can also be added to [row columns](notion://www.notion.so/grid/index.html#row-columns). In the following example, we use responsive row columns and responsive gutter classes.

# XML (The Extensible Markup Language)

- XML is **a simple text-based format for representing structured information**: documents, data, configuration, books, transactions, invoices, between programs, between people, between computers and people, both locally and across networks. It was derived from an older standard format called SGML (ISO 8879), in order to be more suitable for Web use. it used to define and store data in a shareable manner.
- An XML document can contains wide variety of data. For example, **database of numbers, a mathematical equation**.
